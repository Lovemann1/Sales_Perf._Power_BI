  # Data Set 
The data set has three main table one is the fact table in which there is all the sales information and another one
is dim account table in which there is information of the account holders and the last one is a dim Plants table that holds information about the products in that case it is the plants.

### Date Modal Diagram

Along with three main tables there are two additional tables created by measures. One is a calendar table that have Dates from beginning of the sales till the last sales. The calendar table is also dynamic if 
 more entries is done in the data the dashboard will automatically update and give the latest result. And the last table is the measure table all the measures that I use in the dashboard are compiled in one table.

 # Dashboard Description 
  Deshboard is consists of Four type of charts and some addition cards each serve a different role in finding the sales pattern. Other then that the dashbord is filter by years so that it will be easy to differentiate between the sales difference between this year sales patterns and last year sales patterns
 
  ## Line and Stack Column Chart

  This chart shows sales by each month for the selected year with respect to the Gross Profit Margin. Total sales by each month which is in the columns shows the sales trand over the year and the line chart tells the Percentage of gross profit margin the each month sales.
  ## Water Fall Chart

  This chart shows the sales comparison of this year and last year. This chart gives a clear understanding of sales difference from last year and tells you the inside like, sales of which category of porduct increase from last year and which category sales decrease from last year.
  ## The Donut Charts
  ![dounat charts](https://github.com/Lovemann1/Sales_Perf._Power_BI/blob/main/Assets/Sales%20by%20Product%20Category%20and%20Size.png?raw=true)
  These two donut charts helps us to understand the relationship of product category and product type With sale and the gross profit. First chart is divide into three types of the produch and the percentage repersent the total portion of the sales that the perticular category covers. The another donut charts cover the size realtion with sales factors. With the help of these two charts you can also find the trand of category i.e. by looking the the sales a person can comparison it from last year sales any find petterns in it.
  ## The Treemap 
  ![countries with highest sale drop](https://github.com/Lovemann1/Sales_Perf._Power_BI/blob/main/Assets/Countries%20With%20highest%20sales%20droping%20from%20last%20year.png?raw=true)
  <rn>
  
  This charts give you the countries which has the highest sales droping from last year sale. From this chart you can easily find the countries where you did really good last year but not so good this year 

  # Observations And Recommendations

  - China sales drop half of million in 2023 and third/forth of million in just four months of the 2024. This shows that china has huge potential and by finding the reasons of these sales drop and by working on it we can enhance the sales 
  - Not only sales is decreasing over the years but the profit margin is also decreasing. This is a big consern because we are not only selling less quantioy but also getting less profit from every sales.
  - Large size plants often have high gross profit margin. But the sales of large size plants are not consistent. Finding the pattern in the sales of large size plants can help in bust up the sales and the gross profit.
# Skills I used 
- Data Preparation & Cleaning:- Load the data from excel and clean it in power query.
- Data Modeling :- Make a realtionship between the dim tables and fact tables.
- Dax Functions:- Use measures, calculated column and create a calendar table for comparison visualisation.
- Visualizations :- Create multiple charts for better visualizations and understading.
# Conclusion 
In this project, I designed a Power BI deshboard to analyze sales performance. With the help of it I was able to uncover key insights that support data-driven decision-making.
